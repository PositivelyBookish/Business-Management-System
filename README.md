“Comfort Marketing” is a python based menu driven textile business management system which could cater a wide variety of bottom wear. There are several levels of menus , which lets the user add, search, update, and manage all the details of the stock (for example item name, quantity,etc.) as per his/her requirements. It would iterate over the stock again and again while selling to allow inclusion of items if desired by the user or directly to proceed to billing.

The billing panel generates a bill which lists all the items selected by the user and displays the billing information along with the amount returned and the time of billing thus generated.

The application follows all standard coding practices, uses dynamic data structures like lists for better memory efficiency, functions which increases the program readability and code re - usability, binary file handling which is more efficient and faster than text files.The application mimics a real world business management system to the maximum possible extent.

The application is scalable i.e. it could be readily deployed and extended for any simple textile management system, easy to understand and maintain, and exploits the object - oriented capabilities of python to the maximum extent.
